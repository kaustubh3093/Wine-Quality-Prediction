# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Based on the physio-chemical tests the data set has 11 independent variable and 1 output variable for a wine where the output variable is quality of the wine with score 0 is worst and score of 10 is the best. Required to build at-least 2 and predict the results. 

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Also, as we are not sure if all input variables are relevant So, we applied PCA to extract the relevant feature out of the 11 independent variable.

No of instance: 4898

 Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
   1 - fixed acidity
   2 - volatile acidity
   3 - citric acid
   4 - residual sugar
   5 - chlorides
   6 - free sulfur dioxide
   7 - total sulfur dioxide
   8 - density
   9 - pH
   10 - sulphates
   11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
